# NeuralNetworks

Assignment1
Implementation of different MLP models for CIFAR-10 Dataset and compared each of them and find out the best according to my findings

Also build CNN with and without Data Augmentation

Assignment 2
Part 1 --- Nvidia Course: Fundamentals of Deep Learing for Computer Vision
Documentation and readings of full course.

Part 2-- Build best CNN model for tiny-imagenet dataset
         Implemented Auto Keras
         Implemented Alexet structure using keras layers
         Using xception as pretrained model build model by adding layers to existing model
         Implemented transfer learning on cifar 10
